# Start of Machine Learning Pool Project

## Goals

Current: 
    Use OpenCV to keep track of the cue ball

Future:
    Track other balls on table
    Get next shot on a 9-ball game
    Potentially have a best shot to play (Ambitious/Far Future)

## Steps 

1. Apply GaussianBlur and HSV to get a circle around the cue ball
